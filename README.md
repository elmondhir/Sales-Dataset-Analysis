# Sales-Dataset-Analysis

Sales analysis is mining our data to evaluate the performance of our sales team against
its goals. It provides insights about the top performing and underperforming products/services, the problems in selling and market opportunities, sales forecasting, and
sales activities that generate revenue.
Regular sales data analysis provides an understanding of the products that our customers are buying and helps us to dissect why they are behaving in a certain way. We
can also find patterns in your lead conversions and drop offs. All of these aspects enable
us to optimize your sales process

## Identifying Problem Statements
Our problem statements reflect on our business Objective, i.e what we hope to accomplish from this project (report), in this case we can summarize them in the following
points.

- Analyze historical revenue and profit data.
- Production cost analysis.
- Identifying Best-selling products
- Customer/Country detailed revenue analysis (drill-through)
